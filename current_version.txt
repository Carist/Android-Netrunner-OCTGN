2.1.5||
======New Version Information======

New version provides some small but important bugfixes. Please make sure you update to it ASAP.

One new feature added is that you can now inspect your opponents card. 
Just target the card first and then use the "Inspect Target" function on the table context menu (Ctrl+I)
This will means you don't have to first take control of an opponent's card you want to inspect.

Enjoy!
