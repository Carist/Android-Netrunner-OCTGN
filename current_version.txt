2.1.6||
======New Version Information======

New version fixes an significant bug introduced in 2.1.5 where all attempts to declare the runner's link by double clicking on their trace cards would fail with a python error

Please update to 2.1.6 ASAP, and if your opponent gets a python error while playing, make sure they're using 2.1.6+ as well.

(As a sidenote, I'm a bit surprised that nobody reported this bug. Did nobody encounter it, or does nobody use the trace card to boost their link?)

Also included are some bugfixes for cards reducing or increasing costs. 
Multiple Braintrusts and Encryption Protocols should work fine now.

Please update ASAP.
