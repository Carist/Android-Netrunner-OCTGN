2.1.8||
======New Version Information======

NOTE: There's some bug in the forum at the moment which doesn't allow me to edit the main post. 
Go the the last reply in the thread to get the download link.

Ambushes are now more interactive!

When the pop-up window for a Snare! or similar ambush accessed from R&D appears, the runner can now read comunication written by the corp player in the chat box.
Unfortunately they cannot write back, but the pop-up dialogue allows the runner to send a "ping" to the corp to take action if they're taking too long to decide.

Hopefully this should allow the game to progress more comfortably, even without voice communication.
Please make sure to wait until the corp decides to use their accessed ambushes or not before clikging 'Yes'.

There's also a few other bug fixes so please update ASAP.
