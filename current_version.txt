======New Version Details======
(This is likely the first time you see this message. It's a new feature implemented in v1.1.8 which informs you if there is a later version of the plugin available)


We now include Messages of the Day!

These will provide important information to you that can change independent of your installed version. 

Except the MotD, these also include small snippets of information in the form of "Did You Know?" factoids.
These are meant to help you learn tricks about the engine as well as the way the plugin works. Some of them might even ask permission to open your browser to a page with some interesting info

You're very welcome to suggest more "Did You Know" ideas. Tricks on using the plugin better, smart ways to play ANR cards, and even useful websites are welcome additions.
