2.1.10||
======New Version Information======

This version adds code that merges duplicate notifications (e.g. from icebreakers) so that the chat window is much more readable.
Please let me know if this is an improvement.

Also included is a fix for Fetal AI charging the runner 2 credits when scored by the corp normally.
