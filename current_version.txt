1.1.14||
======New Version Information======

In case you haven't noticed, we now record anonymous game stats as you play on OCTGN. 

We then use these to do analysis on the balance between factions and generally some interesting number crunching.

So please, try to finish your games properly (i.e. gather 7 Agenda Points or Flatline). 

If one player considers the game lost, then we have also included a new "Concede" function under the "Game..." menu.

---

Secondly we also implemented a new way to speed up your game!: 

On cards with multiple effects, in the choice menu you can put more than one choice and it will execute them in order.

So if you want, for example, Crypsis to increase its strength by 3 and break two subroutines, you could simply put "11100" in the dialog, and it perform all of these at once.

---

Finally, we have also a new version of the markers file with some amazingly good artwork, as compiled by a user of the french fan forum  http://www.run4games.com
Grab it while it's hot!
