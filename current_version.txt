1.1.13||
======New Version Information======

This update includes some love for the Shapers.

Rabbit Hole now automated
Playing modded should now not try to use Kate as well. Modded will go first and Kate will be used only if there's not enough cost reduction.
Hopefully this update will generally make Kate less prone to tapping for no reason.

Also some other small fixes:

Stopped random cover card (Runner card back) appearing on the table
End Run functions should now clear temp markers for both players
When finding an illegal card in one's deck, it shouldn't just mention "card" anymore
Tinkering should be able to put two traits on an ICE now
