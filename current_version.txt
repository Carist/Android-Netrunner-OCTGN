1.1.16||
======New Version Information======

The new version fixes some important bugs, such as the one which made Once-per-turn Identity cards stop working, or tracing attempts give a python error.
Because of this it is STRONGLY advised you update to this version as soon as possible!

It also has code which checks if this is a possible tournament/league game records this fact (after confirming it with the winner). 
This means we can keep a historical view of all tournament match results as long as the players submit them.

Have fun!
