1.1.17||
======New Version Information======

Slight changes to how runs work: [F3] does not jack-out the runner as well, but merely triggers the successful run effect (Gabriel, Desperato, Bank Job etc). 
This means that you can use both Bad Publicity tokens and Gabe's/Desperado ability at the same time to trash cards for example.

Because [F3] does not finish a run, this needs to be done afterwards with [ESC] or by taking your next action. 
If you've pressed [F3] and take one action, the game will automatically jack you out (so for most players the gameplay should remain the same)

NEW: Added a function to access a card from HQ [Ctrl]+[Q]. Don't use that before confirming with the corp that it's OK to access.

NEW: Now running central servers will automatically trigger their default access command. A confirmation window will pop-up if the runner has successfully run and ask them if they want to use that.

Have fun!
