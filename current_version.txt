1.1.15||
======New Version Information======

We now have a much improved multi-choice menu for cards with more than one ability on use (i.e. most Icebreakers and Ice). 
To use it simply do what you always did, and double click on a relevant card.

Along with this, came better descriptions for those choices. But to make this work...

===!MAKE SURE YOU UPDATE TO CORE SET 1.1.20!===

:::IMPORTANT::: There is a small bug that might hide the multiple-choice window behind the OCTGN window!
(This happens usually if you switched to another program and back to OCTGN without minimizing it)

If you use a card and OCTGN seems stuck and non-responsive, check on your taskbar for a new window in OCTGN's task group.


Finally, a significant change in how Traces work: 
Tracing is done in one action; as soon as you boost your Trace/Base Link strength, it uses your credits.  
It also announces your total in the same line so it should be easier to compare. 

__You do not need to use the trace card a second time per trace!__
  
PS: TollBooth's ability now works according to the rules, so feel free to use it whether your opponent has the money or not.

Enjoy!
