1.1.10||
======New Version Information======

1. You'll never have to patch again!

Well, almost...

With the new version I've implemented code which fetches card scripts from the github repository (https://github.com/db0/Android-Netrunner-OCTGN)

This means that if I discover a broken card script, I do not need to create a patch and ask you to update. 
Rather, I will merely upload the new version online and you'll automatically receive it in your next game!

2. Damage preventions cards like Crash Space and Net Shield now trigger automatically.

Whenever you're inflicting damage (weather to yourself or to another player), the game will check if the victim has a damage prevention card.
If they do, the game will prompt you to activate it if your want to, and will pay the appropriate costs. 

This allows you to use you damage prevention cards when being hit by, say, a snare while accessing R&D.
