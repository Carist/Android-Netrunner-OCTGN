=====Message of the Day======

After 3.4.4.x you can now manually drag cards to or out of the table for installation/trashing. 
Doing so will automatically take care of costs and card restrictions but will retain the card location.

Dragging your ID to the table at the start of the game will also trigger the game setup, which should be more intuitive.

Still, the preferred method is to use double clicks to play cards from your hand and 'del' to trash them. 
But at least the new methods should prevent your MUs from getting messed up in the future.
