=====Message of the Day======

The Chronos Protocols are now rezzed in OCTGN. 

You probably won't find them in online deckbuilders so you'll have to use the OCTGN deck-editor to replace a standard ID in your deck with them.

They're fully scripted, so they should be easy to handle in online play.

Enjoy!
