=====Message of the Day======

I've done some optimization on the script execution. I hope the game now plays less laggy and with less counter mess.

--- Please restart your OCTGN to get the updates! ---

However as a result, events and operations will stay on the table until your end of turn, unless you clear them manually.

Hopefully it will all run better now. Enjoy!
