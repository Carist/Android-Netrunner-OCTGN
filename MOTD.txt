=====Message of the Day======

I've released a minor version 2.1.8.1, which attempts to alleviate the "OCTGN stopped responding" crashing that some people are experiencing often.

If you're one of those whose OCTGN crashes far more than it used to, please install the latest version and see if it makes a difference.

Please let the developer know if things improve or not.

(Do you want to be redirected to download 2.1.8.1?)
