=====Message of the Day======

Hey everyone, this is Db0, the developer of this here fine plugin ;)

I'd like to start casting more games being played for A:NR, particularly for the upcoming BGG Tournament 2. 

If you are in an EU timezone, have some skill in the game, and are fine with me recording your matches to comment and publish as videos, please contact me to arrange a time.

My email address is: mail@dbzer0.com

Cheers!
