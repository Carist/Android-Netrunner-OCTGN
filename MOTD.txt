=====Message of the Day======

!!VERY IMPORTANT!! PLEASE READ.

There's a new bug in OCTGN that is bringing player decks in an out-of-sync state after shuffling.

This means that as a runner, your R&D accesses will not view the top cards of the opponent's deck as the corp sees them.
You will instead be seeing the deck as it was pre-shuffle!!
Other cards like Indexing will also be broken.

There is nothing I can do about this at the moment as it's a serious OCTGN bug.

I've informed the developers and will inform you on the blog and the MOTD when there's any news.
