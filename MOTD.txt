=====Message of the Day======

The two new spoiled identities from FFG have been added to OCTGN! 

They will also both remain available, no matter which one is derezzed via the voting.
So don't think about losing one ID, think of it as one becoming an OCTGN exclusive ;)

Note: In case you made decks with these IDs yesterday, you may have to replace the ID in the deck file, since we've recently had to change the GUID.
