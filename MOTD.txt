A note about voice communication.

The developer of this plugin has setup a Mumble server to allow ANR players to be able to effortlessly connect and voice chat with others. Many players already use it due to its benefits.

Voice communication not only improves the speed of the game significantly, but it also makes it actually _feel_ like a boardgame, of which an important aspect if the player interaction outside of the game rules.

Even if you don't own a mic, take the time to install the mumble client and setup a connection to the server, so that you can connect easily. Even with one side being able to talk, it helps.

Plus, you can almost always reach the developer idling in there. He's a total praise addict!
