=====Message of the Day======

We now have sound effects available in game.

Unfortunately they will only play for OCTGN subscribers, but they are pretty sweet! 
Check some of the recorded games on Twitch.tv or Youtube to hear them.

Some bugs that were fixed that you might have noticed:

* Caissa programs should now install according to their text (i.e. first normally and then re-hosted)
* Reserving a card for Stealth use, won't unset it at the start of the turn.
